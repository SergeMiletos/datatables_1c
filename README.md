This is a simple example of Datatables JavaScript extension library.

Implemented with Python/Django framework.

It takes plain data from the 1C:Enterprise http service, transforms it, groups rows
by the storage location and folders it in visual groups. 

A simple implementation of a click event handler on the document ID field shows 
the document attributes in a pop-up modal window.

Example module of 1C:Enterprise http-service - reportsService_reportsMain.txt

_TODO:_
- Generate mock data file to run Django server without establishing http connection
- Translate cyrillic field names
